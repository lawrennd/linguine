# CIP-0001: Introducing Tenets System for Linguine

## Summary
This CIP proposes the introduction of a formal tenets system for the Linguine project to guide specification design, maintain consistent philosophy, and provide clear principles for contributors and implementers.

## Motivation

As the Linguine specification grows in complexity and scope, having a clear set of guiding principles will help ensure consistency in design decisions, facilitate understanding for implementers, and provide a framework for resolving competing priorities. Tenets serve as touchstones that can be referenced when making decisions about specification features, interfaces, and structure.

These tenets are directly derived from the Linguine [philosophy document](../docs/philosophy.md), which outlines the project's foundation in data-oriented architecture principles. While the philosophy document provides the conceptual foundation, the tenets translate these concepts into actionable principles that can guide day-to-day decision making.

## Detailed Description
We propose establishing three core tenets for the Linguine specification, each directly mapped to the three core philosophical principles in our philosophy document:

1. **Data-Centricity**: Prioritize clear data representations and transformations in the specification rather than implementation details. Design interfaces and operations with data as the primary focus.
   - *Derived from*: Core philosophical principle "Data as First-Class Citizen"
   - *Application*: Specifications should explicitly model the data and its transformations as the central concern

2. **Configuration Over Implementation**: Favor declarative YAML specifications over prescriptive implementation details, allowing different implementations while maintaining consistent behavior.
   - *Derived from*: Core philosophical principle "Configuration Over Implementation" 
   - *Application*: Separation of "what" (in specifications) from "how" (in implementations)

3. **Hierarchy and Inheritance**: Embrace hierarchical structures in the specification to promote reuse and extensibility, enabling users to build on existing configurations.
   - *Derived from*: Core philosophical principle "Hierarchical Structure and Inheritance"
   - *Application*: Specifications should be composable and reusable through inheritance

Additionally, we propose one supplementary tenet that builds upon these core principles:

4. **Format Agnosticism**: Specify support for diverse data formats equally well without privileging any single format, ensuring flexibility across different data sources.
   - *Derived from*: The philosophy document's emphasis on flexibility and practical utility
   - *Application*: Work with data in its native format when possible rather than forcing conversions

Each tenet will be documented in a separate file following the established tenets template, with examples and counter-examples to illustrate proper application.

As the project matures, we may consider adding additional tenets. However, starting with these three core tenets plus one supplementary tenet will provide a strong foundation while remaining manageable and memorable.

## Implementation Plan

1. **Create Tenet Files**:
   - Create individual markdown files for each tenet in the `tenets/linguine/` directory
   - Follow the `tenet_template.md` format for each tenet
   - Include concrete examples and counter-examples for clarity

2. **Generate Combined Documents**:
   - Run the `combine_tenets.py` script to generate combined markdown and YAML versions
   - Add the combined tenets document to specification documentation

3. **Integrate with Project Processes**:
   - Add references to tenets in the main README.md
   - Update CIP and backlog templates to include tenet alignment sections
   - Create a section in specification documentation about using tenets in design decisions

4. **Socialize Tenets**:
   - Introduce tenets to the specification community
   - Apply tenets in upcoming feature discussions
   - Reference relevant tenets in future CIPs and specification changes

## Backward Compatibility
This change does not affect the specification directly but introduces a new framework for decision-making. It will not break existing functionality but may influence future specification decisions.

## Testing Strategy
The tenets system itself doesn't require technical testing, but we will:
- Review each tenet document for clarity and applicability to the specification
- Validate that the `combine_tenets.py` script works correctly with the new tenets
- Test the tenets in practice by applying them to several upcoming specification design decisions

## Implementation Status
- [ ] Create individual tenet files
- [ ] Generate combined tenets document
- [ ] Update project README to reference tenets
- [ ] Update CIP template to include tenet alignment
- [ ] Update backlog task template to include tenet alignment
