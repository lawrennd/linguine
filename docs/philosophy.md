# Linguine Philosophy

## Data-Oriented Architecture for Specifications

Linguine embodies a *data-oriented architecture* (DOA) approach to specifications. While traditional software architectures often prioritize control flow and executable code, Linguine places data at the center of the specification ecosystem. This philosophical foundation draws inspiration from research on data-oriented architectures for machine learning systems ([Cabrera et al., 2023](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.04810)) and applies these principles to the specification domain.

## Core Philosophical Principles

### 1. Data as First-Class Citizen

Linguine treats data as the primary concern of the specification. The interface definitions, transformations, and operations are all described in relation to how they affect data. By placing data at the center:

- Specifications focus on what data exists and how it transforms rather than implementation details
- Data representations remain clear and explicit throughout the specification
- Data flows can be traced, understood, and reasoned about

### 2. Configuration Over Implementation

Rather than prescribing specific implementations, Linguine specifications use declarative YAML to describe desired behaviors. This approach:

- Separates what should happen from how it should happen
- Allows different implementations to satisfy the same specification
- Provides a clear contract between specification creators and implementers
- Empowers domain experts to define requirements without programming expertise

### 3. Hierarchical Structure and Inheritance

Linguine embraces hierarchical specifications that can inherit from and build upon each other. This principle:

- Promotes reuse of common patterns and configurations
- Allows incremental extension of existing specifications
- Creates a natural organization of related specifications
- Reduces duplication and maintenance burden

### 4. Format Agnosticism

Linguine is designed to work equally well with diverse data formats without privileging any particular format. This approach:

- Accommodates existing data ecosystems rather than forcing conversions
- Recognizes that real-world data exists in many formats
- Enables specification authors to work with the most appropriate format for their domain
- Reduces friction when integrating with existing data sources

## Relationship to Data-Oriented Architecture

Linguine's philosophy aligns with the broader principles of data-oriented architecture described in research by Cabrera et al. (2023). In their paper "Real-world Machine Learning Systems: A Survey from a Data-Oriented Architecture Perspective," they identify several key advantages of data-oriented approaches:

1. **Data availability and transparency**: By explicitly modeling data and its transformations, systems become more transparent and monitored.

2. **Decoupled components**: Components interact through data rather than tightly coupled interfaces, creating more flexible and maintainable systems.

3. **Domain expert accessibility**: The focus on data rather than implementation details makes systems more accessible to domain experts.

Linguine applies these principles to the specification domain, creating a framework that emphasizes data flows, transformations, and representations while leaving implementation details to individual systems.

## Practical Implications

This philosophy manifests in several practical ways in the Linguine ecosystem:

- YAML-based configuration files that describe data structures and relationships
- Explicit mapping of inputs and outputs
- Hierarchical inheritance of specifications
- Support for a wide range of data formats
- Clear separation between specification and implementation

By embracing these principles, Linguine aims to create specifications that are more accessible, reusable, and focused on the essence of data processing tasks rather than implementation details.
